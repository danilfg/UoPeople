This is my presentation compare and contrast to items.
In this presentation I will compare and contrast two ways of making payments.
NEXT

I will compare paying with cash VS paying digitally
I will compare the convenience and I will compare the time frame how fast they are.
NEXT
I personally prefer paying digitally, weather by cell phone or online.
NEXT
Paying digitally Require some form of technology which my be disadvantage compare to payment cash because it does not require expensive gadgets
when you paying with cash you might need a change and therefore it may lose sometime, digitally is easy to process any amount.

Also for cash you need requires a secure place for keeping compare to digitally it does not take any space.

Finally money can be stolen and digitally could be by affected fraud or scum.
